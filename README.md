This Python program is a menu-driven application designed to help users analyze continuous numerical data by grouping it into classes and computing statistical measures. Users can input data, define class width, generate frequency distribution tables, and visualize the results using a histogram.

The project demonstrates how to:
- Accept user input and save data into a CSV file.
- Read and display raw data and summary statistics.
- Group data using user-defined class widths.
- Calculate key statistics (mean, median, mode, modal class, variance, standard deviation).
- Visualize the grouped frequency distribution with a histogram.
- Save all results into separate CSV files.
